## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobin-automation.git
    cd jobin-automation
    

2. **Install dependencies**:
    bash
    npm install
    

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
    
    EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    PASSWORD=your-email-password
    NOTIFY_EMAIL=notify-email@example.com
    PORT=3000
    

4. **Configure accounts and settings**:
    - `config/accounts.json`: Add your LinkedIn accounts and Jobin license assignments.
    - `config/config.json`: Configure general settings like intervals, proxy settings, and thresholds.

    Example `config/accounts.json`:
    json
    [
      {
        "username": "linkedin_user_1",
        "password": "password_1",
        "profile": "chrome_user_profile_1"
      },
      {
        "username": "linkedin_user_2",
        "password": "password_2",
        "profile": "chrome_user_profile_2"
      }
      // Add more accounts as needed
    ]

    Example `config/config.json`:
    json
    {
      "interval": "0 * * * *",
      "maxInvitations": 900,
      "proxy": {
        "address": "your-proxy-address",
        "port": "your-proxy-port",
        "username": "your-proxy-username",
        "password": "your-proxy-password"
      }
    }
    

## Usage

1. **Ensure VPN/Proxy is set up**:
    - If using a VPN, ensure it is connected and set to New York City.
    - If using a proxy, ensure the proxy settings in `config/config.json` are correct.

2. **Run the application**:
    bash
    node app.js
    

3. **Using a process manager (optional)**:
    To keep the application running continuously, use a process manager like PM2:
    bash
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start app.js
